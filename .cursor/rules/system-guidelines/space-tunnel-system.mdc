# Space Tunnel System – Space Trucker

Space tunnels are **player-constructed highways** between points in a star system. Once built, they provide **speed boosts** during flight and symbolize rebuilding collapsed infrastructure.

---

## 🎮 Player Fantasy

- Build faster routes for future deliveries.
- Contribute to infrastructure like a real trucker guild member.
- Unlock shortcuts to stations and gates.

## 🛠 Responsibilities

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Track global tunnel state | Built/unbuilt status saved per system |
| Handle material contributions | Track what the player has added |
| Trigger build completion | Activate effects once materials are complete |
| Provide in-flight bonuses | Speed boost, visual indicators |
| Show UI overlays | Mark paths, completion %
| Sync with map loading | Load tunnel data from system file |

---

## 🧱 Tunnel Object Schema

Each tunnel is defined in `star-system.mdc`:

```ts
{
  id: "route-halyard-east",
  start: { x: 900, y: 1200 },
  end: { x: 2400, y: 1200 },
  isBuilt: false,
  buildRequirements: {
    alloy: 10,
    energyCells: 3
  },
  speedMultiplier: 2.5
}
```

Internally, the system stores:

```ts
{
  id: "route-halyard-east",
  contributed: { alloy: 7, energyCells: 2 },
  isBuilt: false,
  lastUpdated: "2025-07-01T12:45Z"
}
```

## ⚙️ Key Methods

```ts
contributeMaterial(tunnelId: string, material: string, amount: number): boolean
```
Adds to the contribution count and checks if complete.

```ts
checkCompletion(tunnelId: string): boolean
```
Returns whether tunnel is now active and updates state.

```ts
getSpeedBonusIfOnTunnel(shipX, shipY): number
```
Checks proximity to completed tunnels and returns bonus.

## 🧩 System Interactions

| System | Interaction |
|--------|-------------|
| Star System Loader | Loads tunnels from JSON and registers state |
| Inventory | Verifies if materials are present |
| UI Manager | Displays route overlay, contribution panel |
| Save/Load | Persists tunnel status globally |
| Flight | Applies speed multipliers based on position |
