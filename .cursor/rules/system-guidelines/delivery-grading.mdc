# Delivery Grading System – Space Trucker

This system calculates a letter grade (S–F) based solely on cargo durability at the time the job is turned in.

---

## 🎯 Player Fantasy

- You're a professional courier. Handle with care.
- Better care = better reward.
- There are no fail states — just XP, trust, and story growth.

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria (Simplified)

| Category         | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Cargo Durability** | Measured 0–100% per item. Grading is based on final condition at delivery. |

---

## 🅰️ Grade Breakdown

| Grade | Durability Range | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| **S** | 96-100%          | Flawless. Perfect delivery. |
| **A** | 85–95%           | Nearly flawless. |
| **B** | 65–84%           | Minor scuffing. Acceptable. |
| **C** | 40–64%           | Damaged, but usable. |
| **D** | 10–39%           | Barely intact. |
| **F** | < 10%            | All but destroyed. Still accepted, but with strong penalty. |

## 🔗 System Interactions

| Interaction | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Reads from | `Inventory` (cargo durability), `Job Logbook` (job data) |
| Triggers | `onJobGraded(jobId, grade)` and `onRewardGranted(...)` |
| Updates | XP gain, Faction/Station rep, Job completion flags |

## 🛠 Mechanics

- **Trigger**: Runs when player manually turns in a completed job
- Pulls cargo durability from player’s `Inventory`
- Calculates average condition across all cargo assigned to that job
- Applies grading scale (above)
- Outputs grade and attaches it to the job history

```ts
jobHistory.push({
  jobId: "auriga-death-haul",
  grade: "B",
  rewardsGiven: true
});
```

## 🧼 Notes

- XP and Rep gain scale with grade
- Flavor text can change based on grade ("Next time, bring bubble wrap.")
- Some future jobs may require **minimum grades** to unlock follow-ups
