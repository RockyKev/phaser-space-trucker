# Job Posting System â€“ Station-Side

This system governs how jobs are **generated and displayed** at each station.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

- Populate the **station job board**
- Enforce prerequisites before a job appears
- Align jobs with station ownership, faction alignment, and flavor

---

## ðŸ§± Job Posting Object

```ts
{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  type: "main" | "side" | "misc";
  originStationIDs: string[];     // If blank, available everywhere
  destinationID: string;
  factionID: string;
  cargoType: string;
  reward: {
    credits: number;
    xp: number;
    items?: string[];
  };
  repeatable?: boolean;
  repeatDelay?: number;           // Optional: Jobs return after X completions
  prerequisites?: string[];       // Other job IDs
  flags?: string[];               // e.g., ["contraband", "corpse", "delicate"]
}
```

## ðŸŒ€ Station System Logic

1. Gather jobs from all data sources
2. Filter:
   - Must match this stationâ€™s `originStationIDs`
   - Must meet faction rep, station rep (optional, TBD)
   - Must not be blocked by unmet prerequisites
3. Push to job board UI

---

## ðŸ”„ Respawn Logic (For Repeatables)

- After a delay or player completion count
- Job becomes valid again for reposting
