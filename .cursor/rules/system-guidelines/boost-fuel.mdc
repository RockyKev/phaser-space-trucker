# Boost Fuel System â€“ Space Trucker

This system controls short-term boosts activated by the player during Phase 2: In-Flight Travel. Boosts are tied to ship modules, optionally affected by player stats, and consume per-type fuel.

## ðŸŽ® Player Fantasy

Boost Fuel lets the player:
- Go faster through long hauls
- Traverse hostile or Dense Space
- Temporarily activate defensive or smuggling protections
- Feel clever, not restricted

## ðŸ§  Functional Summary

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Core Mechanic | Spend Boost Fuel to activate short-term effects while in-flight. |
| Ship Modules | Determine which kinds of boost are available. |
| Player Stats | May affect boost efficiency, or fuel use. |
| Fuel Type | Tracked per boost type. |
| Use Case | Manually triggered by the player, optional utility. |
| Refill Method | At stations or fuel caches. |

## ðŸŽ¯ Boost Types (Examples)

| Name | Effect | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Speed Boost | Temporarily increases flight speed | Simple and common |
| Barrier Boost | Temporary defensive field | Good in asteroid belts |
| Density Bypass | Fly through Dense Space (normally blocked/slowed) | Gatekeeping function |
| Ghost Silencer | Suppresses corpse signal emission | Needed when carrying body cargo |
| Gravity Stabilizer | Nullify the chaotic effects of intense gravity wells | Gatekeeping function |
| Environmental Purifier | Fly through harmful atmospheric conditions, like corrosive gases or radiation | Gatekeeping function |
| Energy Field | Fly through environmental energy/space energy | Gatekeeping function |
| Holographic Decoy | Project a holographic duplicate of your ship | Distracts tracker ships |

- Reads from: `ShipConfig`, `Stats`
- Updates: `GameState.boostFuel`
- Emits: `boostActivated(type)` via `EventBus`
- Affects: Flight HUD visuals, Audio cues

## ðŸ›  Mechanics

- **Boost Activation Checks**:
  - Player is currently in-flight
  - Ship has module that supports boost
  - Enough fuel is available

- **Fuel Format Example**:
```ts
boostFuel: {
  speed: 4,
  barrier: 2,
  bypass: 0,
  ghost: 0,
  gravity: 0, 
  purifier: 0,
  energy: 1,
  decoy: 2
}
```

- **Activation Flow**:
  1. Input triggers boost
  2. Checks + consumes fuel
  3. Applies temporary effect

## ðŸ§ª Debug & Dev Mode

- Simulate max fuel
- Display HUD fuel values
- Visual overlay for boost effects

## âœ… Summary

- Boosts are optional but impactful
- Zero risk of softlock â€” no boost = no shortcut, not death
- Adds tactical + immersive flavor to long-haul travel
