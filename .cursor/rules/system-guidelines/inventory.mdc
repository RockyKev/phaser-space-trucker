# Inventory System â€“ Space Trucker

The Inventory System manages all player-held items across phases. It supports delivery-linked cargo, damage modeling, and future capacity management.

## ðŸŽ® Player Fantasy

You're a professional hauler. Your cargo is your livelihood â€” track it, protect it, deliver it in one piece.
