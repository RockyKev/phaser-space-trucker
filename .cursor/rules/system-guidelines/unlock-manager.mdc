# Unlock Manager – Space Trucker

The Unlock Manager is a core system that tracks player progression by managing **unlock flags**. These flags control access to lore, tutorials, achievements, and other progression-based content. It centralizes conditional checks across all systems.

## 🎯 Core Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Track unlock flags | Boolean or numeric flags indicating what the player has unlocked |
| Evaluate conditions | Periodically or reactively check player data (inventory, stats, jobs) |
| Trigger side effects | Reveal encyclopedia entries, tutorials, UI changes, etc. |
| Provide debug access | Show current unlocks, allow manual override/reset |
| Save/load state | Persist across sessions |

---

## 🧠 Example Unlock Flags

```ts
{
  "tutorial-fuel-usage": true,
  "item-corpse-pod-1": true,
  "item-corpse-pod-2": false,
  "system-pale-halo-completed": true,
  "faction-auriga-rep-100": false
}
```

## 🔁 Flag Evaluation Rules

| `tutorial-*` | First-time use of a system |
| `item-*` | Held or delivered specific items |
| `job-*` | Completion of specific jobs |
| `faction-*` | Reaching reputation milestones |
| `system-*` | Visiting or restoring a system |
| `book-*` | Reading lore books |

## 🧩 System Interactions

| System        | Usage |
|---------------|--------|
| Encyclopedia  | Reveals entries per unlock flag |
| Stats         | Flags triggered by stat milestones |
| Job Logbook   | Flags triggered by story completions |
| Inventory     | Unlocks from item tracking |
| Radio         | Gated radio logs |
| Save/Load     | Persist unlock state |
