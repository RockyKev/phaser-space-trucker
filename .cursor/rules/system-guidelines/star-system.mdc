# Star System – Space Trucker

Each star system is a hand-authored JSON map file that controls layout, behavior, and system-specific rules. It contains station locations, hazards, encounters, gates, and player-buildable infrastructure like space tunnels.

---

## 🪐 Star System Object

```ts
{
  id: "auriga-beta",
  name: "Auriga Beta",
  description: "A war-torn outpost system. Still smells like ozone.",
  tags: ["haunted", "dense-space", "no-corpses"],

  bounds: { width: 8000, height: 6000 },
  background: "auriga_nebula.png",

  laws: {
    contraband_flags: ["corpse", "haunted", "unsealed"],
    restrict_flags: ["weapon", "biohazard"]
  },

  ambientAudio: "haunted-wind-loop.mp3",
  radioOverrides: ["auriga-radio-jazz", "pirate-news"],

  stations: [ ... ],
  encounters: [ ... ],
  gates: [ ... ],
  hazards: [ ... ],
  spaceTunnels: [ ... ]
}
```

---

## 🛰️ Stations

Each station defines its position, reputation gates, and enabled offerings.

```ts
{
  id: "moon-a7-cove",
  name: "The A7 Cove",
  position: { x: 1300, y: 900 },
  factionId: "auriga-union",
  flavor: "Just one guy on a rock. He brews his own gin.",
  traderId: "auriga-default",

  access: { minRep: -100 },
  offerings: {
    jobBoard: { minRep: -1 },
    trader:   { minRep: 10 },
    shipyard: false,
    facilities: {
      bar: { minRep: -1 },
      shower: false,
      bed: { minRep: 50 },
      supervisor: { minRep: 100 }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 👾 Encounters

```ts
encounters: [
  { id: "corpse-signal-01", randomEncounterChance: 0.2 },
  { id: "ghost-scan-checkpoint" }
]
```

> Encounters are referenced by ID from the encounter registry. Each one defines its own spatial logic, effects, and repeatability.

---

## 🚪 Gates

```ts
{
  id: "gate-auriga-to-sargon",
  targetSystem: "sargon-prime",
  position: { x: 7800, y: 2800 },
  isActive: false,
  toActivate: {
    materials: {
      alloy: 12,
      ai_chip: 1
    },
    requiresSupervision: true
  }
}
```

> Gates may require repair or contribution before use. Controlled by the player.

---

## ⚠️ Hazards

```ts
{
  type: "asteroid-belt",
  position: { x: 2000, y: 3500 },
  proximityRadius: 800,
  onProximityEnter: () => {
    // Reduce speed, flash UI, apply slow visual effects
  }
}
```

> Hazards apply space effects based on proximity — damage, slow, UI distortion, etc.

---

## 🛣️ Space Tunnels (Buildable Roads)

```ts
{
  id: "route-halyard-east",
  start: { x: 900, y: 1200 },
  end: { x: 2400, y: 1200 },
  isBuilt: false,
  buildRequirements: {
    alloy: 10,
    energyCells: 3
  },
  speedMultiplier: 2.5
}
```

> Space tunnels are player-built fast travel lanes that boost movement once constructed.

## 🔗 Systems That Use This

| System | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| Map | Loads spatial objects and sets system bounds |
| Encounters | Registers region-based event triggers |
| Inventory & Law | Validates contraband using system rules |
| Radio | Applies ambient & broadcast changes |
| Job System | Associates job origins with station IDs |

---

## 🧪 Debug & Dev Tools

- Load system by ID from dev UI
- Overlay station/zones in-editor
- Log all proximity/collision events
- Trigger gates and tunnels manually
