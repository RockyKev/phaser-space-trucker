# üõ†Ô∏è Shipyard System ‚Äì Space Trucker

The Shipyard system allows players to buy, store, move, and configure ships at stations that support it. Each station maintains its own **local ship inventory** and **module storage**, providing a flexible and unpunished way for players to experiment with ship loadouts.

---

## üß± Core Features

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Buy New Ship** | Purchase from the station‚Äôs shipyard catalog. The ship is added to that station‚Äôs local storage. |
| **View Stored Ships** | See all owned ships stored at the current station. No storage fees or limits. |
| **Switch Ships** | Swap to another stored ship **if inventory and module limits allow**. |
| **Relocate Ships** | Pay to send a stored ship from one station to another. |
| **Install Modules** | Equip available modules into a ship‚Äôs equipment slots. Modules provide passive or active ship bonuses. |

## üì¶ Inventory & Module Constraints

- Each ship has:
  - `maxInventoryCapacity` (how many cargo units it can carry)
  - `equipmentSlots` (number and type of modules it can install)
- **Modules** are physical items:
  - Take up **2 cargo units** when unequipped
  - Stored in station cargo or carried by ship
  - **Can be transferred** between ships using cargo space

### üîÑ Switching Rules

- When switching ships:
  - All **modules are auto-unequipped**
  - All **cargo is offloaded**
  - If offloading would **exceed cargo limits**, the swap is blocked
  - The player must manually clear space before switching

## üß∞ Sample Shipyard Interface (Conceptual)

- **Tab 1: Purchase Ships**
  - Lists ship classes, stats, cost, description
- **Tab 2: Stored Ships**
  - Ships stored at this station
  - Buttons to switch, relocate, or sell
- **Tab 3: Module Loadout**
  - Shows equipped modules + open slots
  - Drag from inventory to equip
- **Tab 4: Relocation**
  - Pick ship ‚Üí destination station ‚Üí pay fee

## üîÅ System Interactions

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Inventory System** | Cargo checks when switching or transferring modules |
| **Stats System** | Stores ship ownership, usage stats |
| **Trader System** | Purchases modules used in Shipyard |
| **Station System** | Tracks ship + module storage per location |
| **Unlock Manager** | Some ships or modules may be locked until later progress |

## üß™ Debug Tools

- Force unlock all ships
- Bypass inventory checks
- Auto-swap to specific ship ID
- Free relocation toggle

## üß© Future Considerations

- Advanced module interactions (combo modules, restricted slots)
