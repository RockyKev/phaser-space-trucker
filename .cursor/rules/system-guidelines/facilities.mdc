# üõ†Ô∏è Facilities System ‚Äì Space Trucker

Facilities are available at most stations, offering immersive trucker downtime. The player can overhear multi-character **rumors**, **rent a room**, **shower**, or **speak with the station supervisor**, all through a stylized dialogue presentation system.

---

## üß± Core Facilities

| Facility | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Bar** | Order a drink (options based on the station‚Äôs faction). The player overhears a fully-scripted rumor using the dialogue system. Rumors may unlock jobs, lore, or be ambient flavor. |
| **Rent a Room** | Cosmetic. The player can pay to stay the night. Future potential includes profile customization. |
| **Shower** | Cutscene with ambient chatter or internal monologue. Grants a temporary ‚ÄúClean‚Äù buff. Adds flavor and immersion. |
| **Speak with Supervisor** | Requires sufficient **station reputation**. Unlocks lore, deeper station history, or new unlock flags. Supervisors are unique NPCs per station. |

## üéôÔ∏è Rumor System

- Rumors are implemented using the **dialogue system**, with multiple characters and player proximity.
- Rumors can:
  - Trigger new jobs
  - Unlock encyclopedia entries
  - Just provide color (flavor-only)

```ts
{
  id: "rumor-black-market",
  type: "job-unlock",
  unlocks: ["job-black-market-supply"],
  dialogId: "rumor_black_market_script"
}

{
  id: "rumor-collapse-story",
  type: "encyclopedia",
  unlocks: ["history-collapse-massacre"],
  dialogId: "rumor_collapse_script"
}

{
  id: "rumor-space-chickens",
  type: "flavor",
  dialogId: "rumor_space_chickens"
}
```

- Rumors are selected randomly and repeat rarely unless debug tools are used.
- **No rumor is locked by faction**. The drinks change by faction, not the rumor pool.

---

## üçª Faction Drink Mapping

Each faction defines its drink offerings using a shared JSON config:

```ts
{
  "humans": ["Wheat Beer", "Cola", "Dark Whiskey"],
  "glipglork": ["Green Sludge", "Tomato Sauce", "Dr. Pepper"],
  "dustwalkers": ["Boiled Vapor", "Battery Acid", "Moon Cider"]
}
```

- These drinks are **cosmetic only** but contribute to world flavor and station identity.

| **Stats**           | Tracks shower use, drinks consumed |
| **Job Board**       | Rumors may add new jobs |
