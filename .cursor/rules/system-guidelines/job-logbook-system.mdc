# Job Logbook System – Player-Side

This system tracks **jobs the player has accepted or completed**.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Persist job progress across phases
- Show status in the Logbook UI
- Notify systems on acceptance, progress, or completion

---

## 🧾 Data Structure

```ts
{
  activeJobs: Job[];
  completedJobs: Job[];
}

type Job = {
  id: string;
  acceptedAt: string;              // timestamp
  completionStatus: "pending" | "delivered";
  qualityGrade?: "S" | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "F";
}
```

## 🛠️ Responsibilities

- Track all jobs taken
- Limit to 20 activeJobs max.
- Handle filtering by type, faction, destination
- Interface with:
  - In-Flight Decision Engine
  - Delivery Grading System
  - Reputation System

---

## 🔁 Lifecycle (Player View)

1. Accept job → saved to `activeJobs`
2. During arrival at a destination (Station, Point of Interest) → job checked for progress
3. On delivery:
   - Rewards triggered
   - Grade awarded
   - Moved to `completedJobs`

---

## ✅ Notes

- No expiration or deadlines
- No punishment for failed deliveries — only missed XP
- Used across **all phases**
