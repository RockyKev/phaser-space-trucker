# 🧠 Encyclopedia System – Space Trucker

The encyclopedia serves as the in-game codex, tracking what the player has learned about the galaxy. Entries unlock through item delivery, faction interaction, job completions, and stat milestones. Categories include tutorials, items, factions, star systems, and universal history.

## 📚 Categories

| Category        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Tutorials**   | Instructions on gameplay systems; unlocked by use |
| **Items**       | Each item seen or delivered unlocks an entry |
| **Factions**    | Reveals faction info via rep milestones, jobs, or books |
| **Star Systems**| Unlocked by visiting or restoring systems |
| **History**     | Lore gained from books or milestone jobs |

  title: "Corpse Pod",
  category: "items",
  levels: [
    {
      unlockCondition: "hasDelivered('corpse-pod', 1)",
      text: "A sealed stasis chamber used to contain remains."
    },
    {
      unlockCondition: "hasDelivered('corpse-pod', 5)",
      text: "Pods are used to minimize scent signature. Older pods may leak."
    },
    {
      unlockCondition: "hasDelivered('corpse-pod', 20)",
