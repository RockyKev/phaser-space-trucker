# 🚚 Project Overview: *2025 – Space Trucker*

## 🎮 What It Is

A **survival-focused space cargo sim**, inspired by *Euro Truck Simulator*, *Death Stranding*, and *Freespace* — but with zero combat. You pilot a ship across a handcrafted galaxy, picking up and delivering cargo, navigating space hazards, and adapting to a strange post-war economy shaped by death-avoidant cultures.

---

## 🎯 Experience Goal

You’re not a hero. You’re a hauler.

The fantasy is about:
- **Surviving in a complex, haunted galaxy**
- **Keeping your ship running**
- **Making logistical and moral decisions**
- **Choosing which jobs to take, which factions to support, and which truths to ignore**

There are **no enemies to shoot**, only cargo to move and systems to outthink.

## 🌀 Core Gameplay Loop (Simplified)

1. **Docked Phase** – Accept jobs, refuel, trade, plan next destination
2. **In-Flight Phase** – Fly through 2.5D space, encounter optional events, listen to radio, use boost fuel
3. **Delivery Phase** – Drop off cargo, earn rewards, receive job grading
4. **Post-Delivery Phase** – World reacts to your actions, new jobs unlock, loop restarts

All player systems (Inventory, Stats, Email, Logbook) persist between phases.

## 🗺️ Key Systems

| Category | Systems |
|---------|---------|
| **Player Systems** | Inventory, Job Logbook, Map, Stats, Email, Encyclopedia |
| **Station Systems** | Job Board, Trader, Shipyard, Facilities, Station Representative, Ship Configuration |
| **Flight Systems** | Boost Fuel, Encounter System, Radio, Space Environment |
| **Shared Systems** | GameState Manager, EventBus, Save/Load |
| **Optional Tools** | Debug overlay, Simulator mode, Data injection (dev only) |

---

## 🌌 Tone & World

- **Post-collapse** (not post-apocalyptic): the war is over, but paranoia, trauma, and death fears linger
- **Death is dangerous** — monsters track scent trails from corpses, so body disposal is highly regulated
- **Factions** have complex trade, moral, and disposal laws
- **Travel feels lonely** — filled with quiet tension, ambient discoveries, and low-grade risk

---

## ✴️ Key Features

- ✴️ **No combat** — only strategy, logistics, and moral decisions
- 📦 **Cargo-centric gameplay** — jobs may involve contraband, corpses, biohazards, or rumors
- 🚢 **Ship module upgrades** — different ships suit different hauling needs
- 🧠 **Job quality grading** — better delivery = better XP, more trust
- ⚖️ **Faction + station rep** — both tracked separately, impacts job access
- 🪐 **Hand-authored star systems** — handcrafted worlds, not procedural
- 🔄 **Phase-based loop** — each phase triggers and disables a unique set of systems

---

## 🧱 Architecture Summary

- Phaser game, structured around a single persistent `GameScene`
- Modular systems grouped by gameplay phase
- **GameState Manager** used for shared state across systems
- **EventBus** used for system communication and lifecycle hooks
- AI and dev tools can simulate jobs, tweak stats, or trigger in-game flags

---

## 🧪 Development Principles

- Every system is testable and swappable
- No direct system-to-system calls — always use GameState or EventBus
- UI and logic are separated
- Scenes should be debug-aware
